# Project_RPI

**Restricted Path Integral Approach for Quantum Decoherence Correction in Nonadiabatic Dynamics**

This project presents the restricted path integral (RPI) method

## Data Structure and Descriptions

- `SBH/`
  A folder for the NBRA-TSH and RPI dynamics on the spin-boson Hamiltonian (SBH) system

- `C60/`
  A folder for the NBRA-TSH and RPI dynamics on the C60 system

- `Plot_all.ipynb`
  Jupyter notebook for plotting figures

## Instructions

Each folder include a `README.md` with:
- A short description of its purpose
- Detailed steps for running the code
- Expected input/output files

Ensure dependencies are met before running simulations (Libra, Python 3.x, etc.)
