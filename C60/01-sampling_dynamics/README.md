## Folders

* `step1/` - Ground-state dynamics of C60 with CP2K

* `step2/` - Time overlap calculation along an NBRA trajectory

* `step3/` - Nonadiabatic coupling calculation along an NBRA trajectory

## Note

* Run calculations in the order of step1, step2 and step3 to obtain the vibronic Hamiltonian and time overlap
